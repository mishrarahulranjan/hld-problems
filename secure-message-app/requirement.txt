Problem statement:

Design a highly scalable system to secure saas apps like slack, gdrive, dropbox etc.
   i.  App should poll each message from saas apps and check if message is violating policies.
  ii.  If violation is detected, show this in the dashboard  in realtime.
 iii.  Multiple organizations can both use 10 different apps like slack, gdrive, Gmail etc.
  iv.  Dashboard would be different for organizations
   v.  Message process time by this system is 1 min
